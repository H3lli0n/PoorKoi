HLB PoorKoi is a 60% stacked acrylic keyboard

# Why PoorKoi

Well it's a funny joke between a poor version of a well known 60% keyboard kit with a kohaky and also a wordplay with _Pourquoi_ a french word meaning _Why_

# Where can I buy one ?

Unfortunately PoorKoi was a private group-buy on Deltakeyco.com from July 1st to July 15th 2024.
At this time we don't share drawings to produce your own layers and it will be expensive to produce the layers.

# What can I find here ?

Here you'll find the build guide as well as the firmware for pcb. It's based on 4pplet pcb with a custom look and source code is so avaible to matche the open source licence.
The firmware contains only the option avaible with PoorKoi's plate
