# Why PoorKoi

Well it's a funny joke between a poor version of a well known 60% keyboard kit with a kohaku and also a wordplay with _Pourquoi_ a french word meaning _Why_

# Where can I buy one ?

Unfortunately PoorKoi was a private group-buy on Deltakeyco.com from July 1st to July 15th 2024.
At this time we don't share drawings of acrylic layers but plate STEP file is available.

# What can I find here ?

Here you'll find the build guide as well as the firmware for pcb. It's based on 4pplet pcb with a custom look and source code is available to match the open source license.
Firmware is matching our layout as well as options such as:
- Split backspace
- Split left shift
- Iso Enter
- Split spacebar
- WK/WKL/HHKB layout
- RGB underglow
- Capslock LED support

# So what's next ?

Next HLB's project is a TKL made of aluminum with CNC machining. It will be more expensive but others _Poor_ projects will come next.
